BRIEF INTRODUCTION ABOUT MYSELF 
My name is Duho Bismark, a dedicated and goal-driven student from St. Peter’s Senior High School, where I studied General Science and served as the principal speaker of the debate club. I am passionate about the sciences, particularly healthcare, and I am working towards becoming a pharmacist. I have strong interests in data analytics, global health challenges, and improving healthcare systems in Ghana, especially in underserved regions. I am motivated, disciplined, and always eager to learn and take on new opportunities that help me grow academically and professionally.
